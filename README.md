# Summary of Bachelor Thesis and Application Explanation

This project stems from my **Bachelor Thesis** conducted at the **Haute École de Gestion de Genève (HEG)** and explores how **blockchain technology** can be integrated into a peer-to-peer insurance model to improve transparency, trust, and efficiency.

## Summary of the Bachelor Thesis

The Bachelor Thesis, entitled *"How to Integrate Blockchain into Peer-to-Peer Insurance?"*, addresses the limitations of traditional insurance models in terms of transparency, costs, and trust. The goal was to investigate how **blockchain technology**, particularly through its features of immutability, transparency, and decentralization, can offer an innovative alternative for the insurance sector.

### Context and Problem Statement

Traditional insurance systems are largely centralized and rely on intermediaries, such as insurance companies, to manage premiums, reimbursements, and risk coverage. While this model is well established, it has significant limitations: **high costs** due to intermediaries, a lack of **transparency** in fund and claims management, and **trust issues** between policyholders and insurers. These challenges are increasingly relevant in a world where users demand more control and clarity over the management of their insurance.

**Blockchain technology** provides a solution to these issues with its decentralized nature. By removing intermediaries, it enables direct and transparent management of transactions. Each piece of data is securely and immutably stored, enhancing user trust. Peer-to-peer insurance, which operates on a collaborative model where network members insure each other, aligns perfectly with blockchain. This thesis therefore focused on how these two concepts can be integrated to create a new insurance model.

### Objectives of the Thesis

The project aimed to:

1. **Explore blockchain technology**: Understand its operation, characteristics, and advantages in an insurance context.
2. **Analyze the peer-to-peer insurance model**: Identify its strengths and weaknesses and examine how it can be enhanced through blockchain.
3. **Develop a functional prototype**: Create a smart contract in **Solidity** to demonstrate the tangible benefits of a decentralized peer-to-peer insurance model.
4. **Evaluate potential benefits**: Highlight improvements in transparency, costs, and trust offered by this model.

The study demonstrated that blockchain, as an innovative technology, can address several challenges in the insurance sector while introducing a fairer, more transparent, and democratic model.

## Application Overview

The developed application is based on a **Solidity smart contract** deployed on the **Ethereum blockchain**. It provides a peer-to-peer insurance system where users directly manage their premiums, declare claims, and vote on reimbursement decisions.

### Key Features
1. **Premium Payment**: Users can pay their premiums directly into the smart contract.
2. **Claim Declaration**: A policyholder can declare a claim and request reimbursement.
3. **Collective Voting**: Network members vote to accept or reject the reimbursement request.
4. **Fund Management**: A portion of the collected premiums is allocated for claims, while another portion is reserved for future periods.
5. **Information Tracking**: All transactions, votes, and decisions are visible and immutable through the blockchain.

### Benefits of the Application
- **Transparency**: Every transaction and decision is accessible and verifiable by all users.
- **Trust**: Network members actively participate in decisions through a voting system, strengthening confidence in the process.
- **Cost Reduction**: The absence of intermediaries reduces the expenses associated with traditional insurance.

## Project Impact

This project demonstrates that integrating blockchain into a peer-to-peer insurance model offers several significant benefits:
- **Elimination of Intermediaries**: Users manage their premiums and claims independently, reducing costs and delays.
- **Total Transparency**: Through blockchain, all transactions and decisions are immutable and accessible to all participants.
- **Enhanced Trust**: Users actively participate in decisions, eliminating doubts about fund management.
- **Collaborative Model**: Insurance becomes a system where members help each other in a fair and transparent way.

## Conclusion

This Bachelor Thesis highlights the potential of **smart contracts** to modernize insurance by offering a decentralized, transparent, and collaborative model. By integrating the **Ethereum blockchain**, it becomes possible to create a peer-to-peer insurance system where transparency and trust are guaranteed while reducing costs linked to intermediaries. This project demonstrates how blockchain technology can address current challenges in the insurance sector while offering an innovative and equitable alternative.
